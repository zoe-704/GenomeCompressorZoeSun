However, for the expand function, Lily and I both experienced the same problem that we were trying to expand the first 2 characters, not the first 2 bits of the compressed sequence. I realized this issue, and Mr. Blick helped Lily and I by recommending we use a while loop to check if the expanded sequence is empty and then use BinaryStdIn.readInt() to get the first 2 bits. Expanded one is empty though. |
| Nov 14 |  8-9pm   | I was reading through my code and realized that I was checking for 00, 01, and 10 for A, G, and C instead of 0, 1, and 2. The output is correct except for 3 extra As in the expanded file and 6 extra 0s in the compressed binary sequence. However, the length of the string declared as n (the number of times the for loop repeats for) is correct, so I'm not sure where the extra 6 bits are from. I realized it's because need a number of bits divisible by 8 because of byte. Implement a header to indicate how many bits appended at end that need to be ignored. Couldn't figure out how to make that work, so I just add a header and then 0s after the header but before the binary sequence representing the letters to make the number of bits divisible by 8. |
